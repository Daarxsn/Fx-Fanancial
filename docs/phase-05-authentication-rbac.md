# Phase 05 — Authentication and Access Control

**Status:** **Phase 05 acceptance gate PASSED** for the implemented local-password authentication and current protected API surface on commit `c658017901f5b8b54d34eadabdf2e9ac32bbf39a`. CI and lockfile/bootstrap both passed, including negative authorization, idle/absolute expiry, revocation, migration 004, OpenAPI validation, lint, TypeScript and production build. This does not imply that future business APIs, SSO/MFA, automated invitation delivery or a live Aiven rollout are complete.

## 1. Implemented authentication strategy and limits

The initial supported strategy is **invited local-password accounts**. Users are not self-registered. An administrator who already has `users:manage` creates an invitation, chooses approved role templates and legal-entity scopes, then delivers the one-time activation token to the invitee through the company's approved secure channel.

- `/login`: email/password sign-in.
- `/activate`: invited account password setup from a single-use token.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/csrf`: short-lived, host-only CSRF cookie and bootstrap token.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: credential verification, rate limit, session creation and success/failure security event.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`: revokes current session and clears auth cookies.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me`: current active user, current roles/permissions/scopes and session expiry.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/activate`: consumes invitation and activates account transactionally.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/revoke-all`: revoke all sessions for current user.
- `GET /api/v1/users`: protected user directory.
- `POST /api/v1/users/invitations`: protected invitation creation with role and entity scoping.
- `PATCH /api/v1/users/{userId}`: protected account-status, role and legal-entity-scope management; privilege changes revoke sessions.

External OIDC/SSO, MFA/step-up, password reset/recovery, automated invitation email delivery, emergency access and identity-provider federation are **not implemented** in this pass. Do not claim them as capabilities. The invitation API returns a newly generated activation token once to a caller with `users:manage`; the API uses no-store and never logs the token. The caller must deliver it out-of-band through an approved secure channel until a mail provider and its controls are configured.

## 2. Credentials, token and session handling

- `app_users.password_hash` stores scrypt hashes only; raw passwords are never persisted. Current policy is 12–128 characters.
- Successful sign-in generates an unpredictable opaque token. Only its SHA-256 hash is stored in `auth_sessions`; the token itself is delivered only through the `HttpOnly` `fx_session` cookie.
- Cookie flags: `HttpOnly`, `Secure` in production, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, eight-hour absolute lifetime. The session is rejected after 30 minutes of inactivity. Last activity is refreshed at most once every five minutes.
- Every protected request looks up the live session and checks revocation, expiration, idle time and current account status. Suspended or deactivated accounts are denied immediately.
- Roles, permissions and legal-entity access are read from current database assignments at request time. The cookie does not carry authoritative client-controlled roles/permissions/scopes.
- Logout marks the row revoked before clearing cookies. Account status, role or scope changes revoke all sessions for the affected user. Revoke-all also supports self-service session invalidation.
- Session tokens are not stored in localStorage/sessionStorage or returned from the login response body.
- The activation token is random, hashed before persistence, 24-hour expiry, single-use and transactionally consumed. The UI removes the token query string from the visible URL after hydration and the app sets a `no-referrer` metadata policy.

## 3. CSRF and same-origin protection

- Cookie-authenticated unsafe requests require an `X-CSRF-Token` header matching the readable, host-only `fx_csrf` cookie.
- State-changing requests must include an `Origin` or `Referer` matching the expected origin; `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` is rejected. `APP_ORIGIN` may pin the exact public origin (scheme and host, no path); in production it must use HTTPS. If unset, the checker compares the origin with the received `Host` and the first `X-Forwarded-Proto` value or request protocol. Behind a reverse proxy, set `APP_ORIGIN` to the public origin and allow forwarding headers only from the trusted proxy.
- For an authenticated request, the CSRF token hash must also match the hash stored against the current server-side session.
- CSRF validation is applied to login, logout, invitation activation, session revocation, invitation/user administration and customer/catalog mutations. Authentication/authorization still runs independently after CSRF validation.
- CSRF rejections return a generic client error. Server diagnostics, when enabled in logs, contain only a fixed reason category, never the actual cookie/header token.

## 4. Rate limits and security-event logging

Migration `004_auth_sessions_and_security.sql` adds session, invitation, rate-limit and security-event tables.

| Scope | Current limit | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Login per normalized email | 5 attempts per 15-minute window | HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` |
| Login per source IP | 20 attempts per 15-minute window | HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` |
| Invitation activation token | 10 attempts per 15-minute window | HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` |
| Invitation create per administrator | 20 attempts per 15-minute window | HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` |

Rate-limit identifiers are HMAC digests rather than raw emails, tokens or IPs. These are per-database buckets, not a distributed edge/WAF rate limit. In deployment, configure a trusted reverse proxy and do not accept spoofable `X-Forwarded-For` from arbitrary clients; `requestSecurityContext` should only be trusted behind a controlled proxy.

Security events record action, outcome and optional actor/subject/network metadata. Subject/IP/user-agent are keyed hashes; credentials, passwords, session cookies, CSRF tokens and invitation bearer tokens are not persisted to logs. Auth events are separate from business audit events.

## 5. Roles and permission templates

Reference seed supplies 22 permission keys and seven role definitions. On first seed only, when `role_permissions` is empty, it assigns a baseline least-privilege permission template to each role. It never creates users, assigns roles to users, or grants legal-entity scopes. If role-permission mappings already exist, the seed does not overwrite them.

| Role key | Baseline responsibility | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `system_admin` | User access, application settings and audit read | No automatic invoice issue, payment reversal or other financial mutation grant |
| `finance_admin` | Approved finance master data and finance workflows | No automatic user administration grant |
| `invoice_creator` | Customer/catalog read and write; invoice draft and quotation work | Cannot issue/cancel invoices or reverse receipts under the baseline |
| `invoice_issuer` | Read customer/catalog/invoices and issue within assigned scope | Does not get payment reversal or user administration |
| `payment_recorder` | Read customers/invoices/payments and record payments | Reversal remains a distinct permission |
| `approver` | Read and decide approval requests | Assignment thresholds/self-approval rules still require business workflow implementation |
| `auditor` | Read-only access to the explicitly granted read surfaces and audit | No customer/catalog/finance mutation grants |

Access still requires both the specific permission and legal-entity scope where applicable. These are starter templates, not approval to assign any actual staff member or issuer entity.

## 6. User and privilege lifecycle

- Invitation creates an `INVITED` local-password account, role mappings, approved entity scopes and hashed single-use token in a transaction.
- Account activation uses a password policy, hashes the password, changes status to `ACTIVE`, consumes the token and revokes other outstanding invitations.
- User administration supports `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED` and `DEACTIVATED`; invitation activation transitions from `INVITED` to `ACTIVE`.
- A status, role or scope change is audited and revokes active sessions immediately.
- A user cannot change their own administrative record through the current user-admin route; this avoids accidental lockout.
- Only an existing `system_admin` may grant/change a `system_admin` assignment. The final active system administrator cannot be demoted or suspended.
- Passwordless invitation records cannot be changed directly to `ACTIVE`; activation through the single-use flow must set a password first.
- A one-time bootstrap script creates the first system administrator when no user has the `system_admin` role. It requires explicit confirmation and environment-provided values; no account or password is committed to source code.

### One-time first administrator bootstrap

After applying the migrations and seeding role templates in the intended database, set the following **in the operator's private shell/deployment environment only** and run `npm run auth:bootstrap-admin`:

- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_CONFIRM=CREATE_FIRST_ADMIN`
- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`
- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (12–128 characters)
- Existing database connection/TLS variables and `SESSION_SECRET`
- Optional `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_LEGAL_ENTITY_IDS` with only approved entity UUIDs; leave unset if no issuer scope has been approved yet.

Do not store these in a tracked `.env` file, paste them into chat, or include them in CI secrets for ordinary application builds. The script is one-time by design, checks for an existing system-admin assignment and prints no credential values. Run it only against the deliberately selected target database. Confirm the actual legal entity mappings before giving any user a billing scope.

## 7. Server-side authorization boundaries

- The default is deny. API handlers call `requirePermission` against the current session's permission set.
- Client-provided permission, role, actor ID and legal-entity scope are not trusted.
- Customer/catalog create routes require write permissions and CSRF; list routes require read permission.
- User directory, invitation creation and user privilege changes require `users:manage`, with additional system-admin and last-admin checks.
- Cross-entity access helpers are available; resource endpoints that operate on a legal-entity resource must call `requirePermissionForEntity`/equivalent and enforce scope in the SQL/service predicate. An ID's existence is not access authorization.
- Future invoice/quotation/payment/document/PDF/export/report routes still need their own server-side permission and scope checks when implemented. The OpenAPI `x-implementation-status` marker distinguishes real routes from planned workflows. This phase does not claim unavailable business routes are protected by their presence in the spec.
- Private downloads, server actions and background jobs must use the same authorization boundary when those capabilities are introduced; never rely on disabled buttons or hidden UI.

## 8. Negative authorization test coverage

The CI API contract test was upgraded from client-signed permission claims to database-created test users with seeded role grants and actual sign-in. It is designed to assert:

- Unauthenticated customer reads are denied with 401.
- Anonymous workspace page requests redirect to sign-in before content is served.
- A forged, client-claimed signed permission payload without a matching database session cannot authenticate.
- Authenticated writes without a CSRF header are rejected.
- An invoice-creator role can use allowed master-data routes.
- An auditor can read but cannot write customer records or list users.
- Suspended accounts cannot log in.
- Valid invitation activation works; replaying its token fails.
- Role changes invalidate old sessions; suspended accounts lose access.
- Logout invalidates replayed old cookies; revoke-all invalidates existing sessions.
- Idle and absolute session expiry both deny a previously valid cookie.
- Account rate limits return 429 with `Retry-After`.
- Existing customer/catalog request validation, response envelopes, pagination and exact-decimal serialization remain covered.

**Completion gate: PASSED** for the implemented authentication and currently exposed protected surfaces. Evidence: [CI run 38054060318](https://github.com/Daarxsn/Fx-Fanancial/actions/runs/38054060318) and [lockfile/bootstrap run 38054060283](https://github.com/Daarxsn/Fx-Fanancial/actions/runs/38054060283), both on `c658017901f5b8b54d34eadabdf2e9ac32bbf39a`.

## 9. Remaining production decisions and limitations

- Confirm whether company-managed OIDC/SSO, MFA and step-up are required before general production rollout. Local-password authentication is implemented for invited users; that is not a substitute for those requirements if policy mandates them.
- Configure secure invitation delivery and password recovery before relying on manual activation token transfer at scale.
- Review trusted proxy/source-IP handling and external edge rate limiting before production deployment.
- Apply migration 004 and seed role templates only after confirming the intended Aiven database, backup/restore readiness and appropriate runtime grants.
- Assign no actual users or entity scopes until the authorized business owner approves the staff roster, roles and legal-entity mappings.
- The permission and account tables exist, but each future invoice/payment/file/export/report handler must independently enforce permission and entity scope before that feature can ship.

Phase 05 is accepted for the local-password/session/RBAC foundation and its current protected surfaces. Future invoice/payment/document/download/export routes must add entity-scope and negative authorization tests when implemented. CI success is not production SSO/MFA approval, mail configuration, approval of actual user/entity assignments, or a live Aiven migration.
